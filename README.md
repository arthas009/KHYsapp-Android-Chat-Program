# KHYsapp-Android-Chat-Program
    -->A simple TCP/IP based Messaging Program.
    
    -->It's server program can be found here https://github.com/arthas009/KhysappServer. This java program should be being executed while you send requests from Android Client.
    
    -->Both server and client should be connected in same networks because this project works on LAN. I'm using port number as 7788 but        Server adress can be changed. So you have to change it from code too.
    
    -->In MainActivity.java make sure the "Targetaddr" variable contains the same value of your Servers IP adress on LAN. You have to check   it.

# Notes
    -->It's a simple program. It does not have notifications yet.
    
    -->Of course you can chat with another android program connected into same LAN.
    
    -->Don't forget to change server adress to where your server program https://github.com/arthas009/KhysappServer runs.
